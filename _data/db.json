      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "Growing up, I did better than average in my academics. There was a clear hirearchy of who was considered smart and who wasn't. I subscribed to the zero-sum game where my being smarter than someone implied that the other person was dumber than I was. I felt bad for the other person and was kinda jealous of the people that were smarter than me. I tried to help people who didn't find academics intuitive because I thought that's the only way they survive this world.\n\nLooking back, I am ashamed at how pretentious I was. The nerve I had, to look down on people. My perspective started to take a shift when I joined college. Here I met a different crowd. There were people good at academics but not necessarily smart enough to implement the things they learned. There were people who got barely got by on their academics but were smart enough to organize and lead events. There were people who could jerk around the entire semester, learn everything at the last minute and still end up in the toppers list. This is when I also realized that the education system is broken.",

      "body": "“People tend to overestimate what can be done in one year and to underestimate what can be done in five or ten years.” - J. C. R. Licklider\n\nDreams are one of the most beautiful survival tactics we have developed. Everyone wants to be the superhero that defeats the bad guys and gets the girl. But we often don't become that person. The issue wasn't that you didn't dream big but that you didn't set small enough goals to achieve them.\n\nIn order to not lose motivation, you must ensure that the dream is chopped up into very small attainable goals. This is even evident from any project that your team at work undertakes. The project is often effort intensive, taking up a year or more. The senior team members that are often the most experienced will split up the project into various phases, these phases might in turn get split into different tasks and assigned to various members of the team. Deadlines might be missed from time to time but the project seems achievable now that there’s a plan.\n\nWhat could happen in some cases is that you over engineer your plan and now your stuck in analysis paralysis. What's important is momentum. You don’t need to plan to the last detail. Plan as you go but keep moving. Also if you dont have a dream yet, take a chill pill and dream. Life is beautiful. Why be reactive to life when you can be proactive ?",

      "body": "Actively ask yourself in every tough situation “Is there something I can do to to decrease the tension ?” If the answer is closer to yes, analyze the situation thoroughly and craft a plan to overcome it. If the answer is closer to no, then stressing about the outcome of the situation is futile and you need to start prepping for the inevitable.\n\nThis is a tricky question especially when you barely have experience with stuff you are dealing with and the answer to that will depend on whether you are an optimistic or a pessimistic person. You need to get better at analyzing these situations and the only way to get there is experience. Try to proactively get yourself involved in uncomfortable situations and get better at figuring out what you can and cannot control.",
